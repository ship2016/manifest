###### Refreshers
* shapes drawn first will be covered by shapes drawn later
* make locations dependant on x and y to be able to place avatars anywhere 

###### Improving your skillz
* start simple
* use a loop to eliminate repeated code

###### For Loops
* different from Python's for loop that iterates over a data set only
* define a variable just to use as a counter
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){  // for (counter declaration; test; inccrement)
    /* stuff to do repeatedly */
}
```
  * the for loop will run whenever the boolean `i < 4` is true
